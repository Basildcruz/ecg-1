Software Defined ECG
====================

This is a reasearch project that investigates the advantages of software defined ECG where in some parts of the analog circuitry are replaced by software. This project is still in the early stages of investigation and is not yet in a position to capture ECG signals.

Dependencies
------------

- Python 2.7
- Arduino >= 1.5.6-r2 (for Arduino Due)
- stream-plot (source included, but streamplot's dependencies need to be met) - https://github.com/s-gv/stream-plot
- MATLAB / Octave if you want to run simulations
